Application development using Cloudant as the database, for me, starts with data design. Having carefully considered how your application's data should be modelled in JSON we may turn to the querying and indexing required:

- How do my queries perform with 10k, 1m or 10m documents?
- How long does it take for a new batch of data to be indexed?
- Is it better to use a Cloudant MapReduce or Cloudant Search index to solve a particular problem?

Oftentimes, app development starts with a blank database. It's helpful at this point to put the theory to the test with a meaningful amount of data - to a/b test two indexes, benchmark queries and measure indexing and throughput performance.

To do this we need a source of data. As our application isn't live yet, we don't have any real data.

This is where the [datamaker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/datamaker) tool comes in.

## What is datamaker?

*datamaker* is a command-line tool that can generate random data. Not just random numbers, but company names, addresses, emails, dates etc.

It's a free, open-source tool published on npm (Node.js & npm are required). To install it, simply run :

```sh
$ npm install -g datamaker
```

Give it a spin by piping in a template string. Placeholders for random data are signified by named tags encased in double curly braces:

```sh
{% raw %}
$ echo 'My name is {{name}}.' | datamaker
My name is Loreta Brenner.
{% endraw %}
```

If you need more data, the `--iterations`/`-i` flag is used to specify the number of data points:

```sh
{% raw %}
$ echo '{{date}},{{company}}' | datamaker -i 10
1975-03-21,Refoment Holdings LLC
1989-12-13,Unmold Stores 
1977-02-10,Psammite Mutual S.A
1983-04-15,Spinsterdom GmbH
2018-06-22,Recite Stores B.V
2012-02-24,Willing SIA
1989-09-22,Pong 
1996-04-28,Sabotage Industries LLC
2004-03-24,Toxidermic Mutual Corp
2014-01-04,Betaine Corp 
{% endraw %}
```

We can use *datamaker* to form CSV or XML data, but for a Cloudant database we need JSON. The best way to do this is to create a template containing one of your documents, with placeholder tags marking where the data should go:

```js
{% raw %}
{
  "_id": "{{uuid}}",
  "name": "{{firstname}} {{surname}}",
  "dob": "{{date 2014-01-01}}",
  "address": {
    "street": "{{street}}",
    "town": "{{town}}",
    "postode": "{{postcode}}"
  },
  "telephone": "{{tel}}",
  "pets": ["{{cat}}","{{dog}}"],
  "score": {{float 1 10 1}},
  "email": "{{email}}",
  "url": "{{website}}",
  "description": "{{words 20}}",
  "verified": {{boolean 0.75}},
  "salary": {{float 10000 70000 0}}
}
{% endraw %}
```

Notice how some of the *datamaker* tags can take parameters: `{{float 1 10 1}}` means "generate a floating point number between 1 and 10, with 1 decimal place.

We can then pass the path of the file to *datamaker* with the `--template`/`-t` option and specify "json" with the `--format`/`-f` flag:

```sh
$ datamaker -t ./template.json -f json -i 10

The *datamaker* project has tens of supported tags - see the [project's documentation](https://github.com/glynnbird/datamaker#tag-reference) for details. Airport codes, URLs, email addresses, prices, currencies etc.

## Importing data into a Cloudant database

The tool to import JSON data into Cloudant already exists: it's [couchimport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/couchimport) which supports the `jsonl` format (one JSON document per line) out of the box. Simply pipe the output of *datamaker* into *couchimport*:

```sh
$  datamaker -t ./template.json -f json -i 10000 | couchimport --db mydatabase --type jsonl
```

The output of the *datamaker* is written to Cloudant in a series of bulk HTTP API calls. Simple as that!
