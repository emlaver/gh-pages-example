In 2017 I blogged about creating [custom indexes outside of Cloudant](https://medium.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/custom-indexers-for-cloudant-6b7e65186db1) for problems that didn't fit Cloudant's indexing engine. One of those was the *count distinct problem*. 

Imagine you are recording web events as people (and bots) interact with your website - events that look like this in JSON documents in a Cloudant database:

```js
{
  "_id": "96f898f0f6ff4a9baac4503992f31b01",
  "_rev": "1-ff7b85665c4c297838963c80ecf481a3",
  "path": "/blog/post-1.html",
  "date": "2018-12-04",
  "time": "17:15:59",
  "mobile": true,
  "browser": "Chrome",
  "ip": "85.25.222.52"
}
```

We want to report on the number of distinct IP addresses that have visited our site but as there are around four billion possible IP addresses, a *count distinct* operation can use vast amounts of memory. At the time, I proposed using [Redis's HyperLogLog](http://antirez.com/news/75) index instead - this achieves an *approximate* count using only a fixed handful of kilobytes of memory.

As of CouchDB 2.2, a HyperLogLog-based *reducer* is available to allow approximate count distinct operations to be performed in MapReduce indexes. Here's how it's done.

## The Map function

We are going to create a MapReduce index whose *key* is the thing we want to count (the ip address). A JavaScript function is defined as the "map" part of the MapReduce to emit the required key:

```js
function(doc) {
  emit(doc.ip)
}
```

This creates an index ordered by ip address - one item per document:

```
1.142.99.0
77.152.2.245
85.25.222.52
```

## The reducer

The new `_approx_count_distinct` reducer will reduce this index to approximate count of the distinct keys in the index:

```
{"rows":[
{"key":null,"value":50133}
]}
```

So across the data set there are approximately 50133 distinct ip addresses (with a relative error of 2%).

At query time, you may also examine ranges of keys. Let's say you wanted to examine traffic from your own local 192.168.* network

```
#?startkey="192.168.0.0"&endkey="192.169.0.0"
{"rows":[
{"key":null,"value":99}
]}
```

## Using the _approx_count_distinct in the dashboard

The MapReduce definition can be created in the Cloudant dashboard:

Add your map function and choose the `_approx_count_distinct` reducer or enter `_approx_count_distinct` in the CUSTOM text box.

## Conclusion

The `_approx_count_distinct` reducer has one job: to provide an estimate of distinct counts (with an accuracy of 2%) much more efficiently than getting a precise answer. It is used in the same way as the other built-in reducers `_sum`, `_count` and `_stats` but remember that it acts on the index's *key*, not the *value*.
