      <description>The beauty of Apache CouchDB and Cloudant is that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to a library to be able to start using it. Some databases require a &amp;ldquo;driver&amp;rdquo; module to be installed to handle communication between your application and your database, but when your database speaks HTTP then you only need curl, a web browser, or anything that can make web requests. For example:
your Raspberry Pi could write IoT data to a remote database by making PUT requests from curl your web page could fetch data directly from the database by making in-page HTTP calls your PHP code could read and write from its data store without any third-party add-on code Sometimes developers need a little help.</description>
