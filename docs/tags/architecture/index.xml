      <description>Cloudant&amp;rsquo;s (and CouchDB&amp;rsquo;s) replication feature allows you to keep databases in sync across countries and continents. However, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s not obvious how to use this basic pair-wise feature in order to create more complicated replication topologies, like three or more geographical replicas, and then how to do disaster recovery between them. Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss these in turn.
Throughout the following, it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that replication is an asynchronous, best-effort process in which a change is propagated to peers sometime after the client receives the response to its write request.</description>
