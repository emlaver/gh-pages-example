      <description>Imagine we have an app that collects geo-coded photographs. We give the app to thousands of students and ask them to collect pictures of storefronts, together with the company name and data from the phone&amp;rsquo;s GPS. Using the latitude and longitude, the company name, and the photograph we intend to crowd-source a business directory.
Our app is based on Offline First design principles. It stores its data locally on the mobile device, syncing to the cloud when there is a decent connection.</description>
