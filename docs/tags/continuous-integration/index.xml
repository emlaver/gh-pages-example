      <description>Modern software development requires a constant feedback loop in which software component correctness and whole-stack integration success can be efficiently validated. This feedback loop is realized through automation and continuous integration (CI). Well-implemented CI is imperative &amp;ndash; it increases transparency amongst developers for all aspects of the software development lifecycle (SLDC) by yielding the ability to rapidly build, test, and iterate on issues that might arise. Rapid iteration is the keystone of an agile workflow and is critical to business success, especially when you&amp;rsquo;re a startup that gets acquired by a company like IBM.</description>
